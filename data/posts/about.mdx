## What I do

I'm a **frontend web developer** who wants to create amazing web apps with clean code. I talk about **web dev**, mostly **JavaScript** and **React**.

At first, I've studied **science** 3 years to become an engineer in physics but then changed my mind to find a new path.

In 2021, I discovered **web dev** and a **passion** was born. Soon after, I started the [**OpenClassrooms React Web App Developer**](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/516-developpeur-dapplication-javascript-react) class and got the degree.

**Web dev** is so fascinating, I always want to learn new things about it. Later I'd like to delve more into backend and discover mobile development.

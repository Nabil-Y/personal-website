## What I do

I'm a **frontend web developer** who wants to create amazing web apps with clean code. I talk about **web dev**, mostly **JavaScript** and **React**.

At first I've studied **science** to become an engineer in physics but I changed my mind and tried to find a new path.

In 2021, I discovered **web dev** and a **passion** was born. Soon after, I started the [**OpenClassrooms React**](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/516-developpeur-dapplication-javascript-react) class and got the diploma.

**Web dev** is so fascinating, I always want to learn new things about it. Later I'd like to learn more into backend and mobile development.

## What I like

I love LoFi / Chill music but I listen to any kind of music. My playlists are some of the most random things in the universe.

I love a good thriller, whatever the medium. Like [**Breaking Bad**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad) or [**Monster**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/19/Monster)

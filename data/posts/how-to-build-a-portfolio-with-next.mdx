## Where to start ?

Building a **personal project** from scratch is hard if you don't know where to start.

I'll try to help and tell you my thought process behind this website's creation.

First, defining what you want to do. For this **portfolio**, there were two main needs:

1. Showcase **projects**
1. Write **blog articles**

Each one has many sub-topics. How to show the **projects**? How to store the data ? What framework to use ? Can I add a like button ? Add a view count ? Should I use a CMS ? A self-hosted database ? Markdown ?

At first I was getting lost trying to figure out what to do or what to use, what might be useful for the future. Then I stumbled upon the **YAGNI** principle.

> YAGNI
>
> Y'Aint Gonna Need It

Short and clear. Us developpers tend to implement features or write code that we might need later.

And more often than not, it ends up being unused. So much time is being wasted.

That's where the **YAGNI** principle comes in. Only write code that you need **now**. Might seem counter-intuitive but it's very useful.

It saved me so much **time** to make a first version of this **portfolio**.

Remember this: Code a feature when you need it, not before.

## The tech

Next comes the time to think about what technology is best suited for your **project**.

Even before starting I knew I'd use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) because it makes your code self-documented and way more reliable than JavaScript.

Also [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) just because I'm a big fan. It makes the styling part a pleasure with component frameworks like React.

It may or may not be the main topic of a future blog post.

```js:./tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  darkMode: "class",
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        sora: ["'Sora'", "sans-serif"],
      },
      colors: {
        // colors
      },
      animation: {
        appear: "appearance 0.2s linear",
      },
      keyframes: {
        appearance: {
          "0%": { transform: "translateY(16px)", opacity: "0" },
          "100%": { transform: "translateY(0)", opacity: "1" },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/typography")],
};

```

For a blog, what comes to mind first is using a [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system).

The idea of using a dedicated headless CMS like Sanity or Strapi was appealing but I wanted to build something simple by myself...

Then I chose [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) for its Static Site Generation (SSG) feature and the many optimisations it comes with.

Also the **blog** will not be hosted on a blogging platform so I need SEO to expose my articles to search engines.

**Next.js** has built in SEO tools so that's a big plus.

## The blog

Static Site Generation is one of the most optimized way to create blogs because the data doesn't change much.

As a result, each page has its own HTML file created and filled with data, ready to be served to your browser. It's **blazingly fast**.

And with the proper setup, your GitHub repo can act like a free and easy to use headless CMS.

To do so, all my **blog posts** are written in the `/data/posts` folder and their content is scraped thanks to Node's `fs` module and `gray-matter`.

```ts:./libs/posts.ts
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";
import readingTime from "reading-time";

const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), "data", "posts");

export const getAllPostsSorted = () => {/* code */ };

export const getAllPostsPaths = () => { /* code */ };

export const getPostData = async (slug: string) => {
  const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${slug}.mdx`);
  const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, "utf8");
  const matterResult = matter(fileContent);
  const readTime = readingTime(matterResult.content).text;

  return {
    meta: matterResult.data,
    mdx: matterResult.content,
    readTime,
  };
};
```

The gray-matter module parses text files and separates meta data ( like the title, description, thumbnail of the page) and the main content of the file.

These functions can then be reused in all pages to return the posts data stored in `/data/posts`.

**Next.js** will use this dynamic page `/pages/blog/[slug].tsx` as a template and generate a static page for each file in the posts folder.

For the **articles**, I chose **MDX** (which stands for Markdown + JSX) instead of simple markdown for three main reasons.

- Be able to use the built-in **Next.js** Image component to optimize automatically article images.

- I was curious about **MDX** and wanted to learn by using it in a **project**. (The quickest way to understand new technologies)

- I could import custom React components and make future articles more interactive (not really **YAGNI** but still, I learned a lot so it's worth it).

```md:./data/posts/how-to-build-a-portfolio.mdx

## Where to start ?

Building a personal project from scratch is hard ...
```

You might notice the `about.mdx` file with the blog posts. It is the about section that is linked in the top navbar.

Using **MDX** would allow me to make quicker edits and still be able to use React components if needed.

So I wanted **MDX** but without setting it up a second time or writing a new function to scrape the content of the about page.

To work around this, I simply reused the **blog post** logic and hid some of the **blog** specific html blocks like reading time or date.

```ts:./pages/blog/[slug].tsx
   // If title is "About me" then the following html will not be used.
   // This method is called short-circuiting

    {title !== "About me" && (
      <div className="flex justify-between text-greyDark dark:text-grey">
        <div>Nabil-Y / {date}</div> <div>{readingTime}</div>
      </div>
    )}
```

## The portfolio

For the **projects** part, I wanted something very simple.

Really had no desire to spend lots of time finding and implementing a storage solution.

There were many options like a database, CMS or reusing the original scraping method of `fs module`.

Instead I opted for a quick and easy one. Yes...

A simple array. Easy and quick but this method can have limitations in readability when I have many, many projects.

Still, It works great for now so there is no need to overcomplicate things.

```ts:./types/types.ts
// Array of Project objects

interface Project {
  repoLink: string;
  demoLink: string;
  title: string;
  tags: string[];
  description?: string;
  imgLink?: string;
}
```

The `description` and `imgLink` keys are optional so I can reuse the component and omit them in the Home Page. Thinking about reusability is key in component frameworks.

## How to start a new project

In summary, here are the steps to quickstart your new **project**:

1. Write the main use cases / user stories
1. Choose the most adequate langages/frameworks/packages for said use cases
1. Write a to do list of the minimum number of tasks to complete the project. Keep YAGNI in mind.
1. Prepare some coffee (or your prefered drink) and start coding!

## Template

![Word cloud with "Open source" theme](/static/blog/how-to-build-a-portfolio/open-source.png)

As a contribution to open source, I made a template so that you can build a **blog / portfolio** like this one in just a few minutes.

Here are the links:

- [Template repository](https://github.com/Nabil-Y/portfolio-template)
- [Live Demo](https://portfolio-template-amber.vercel.app/)

To get started, follow the instructions in the repository's readme.

**Please star the project** if you found it helpful!

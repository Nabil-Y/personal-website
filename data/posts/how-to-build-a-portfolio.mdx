## Where to start ?

Building a **personal project** from scratch is hard if you don't know where to start. I'll help by telling you my thought process behind this website's creation.

First, define what you want to do. For this **portfolio**, there was two main use cases:

1. Showcasing my **projects**
1. Writing **blog articles**

Each one has many sub-topics. How to show the **projects**? How to store the data ? What framework to use ? Can I add a like button ? Add a view count ? Should I use a CMS ? A self-hosted database ? Markdown ?

At first I was getting lost trying to figure out what to do or what to use, what might be useful for the future. Then I stumbled upon the **YAGNI** principle.

```ts:YAGNI.dev
const YAGNI = "Y'Aint Gonna Need It";
```

Short. Clear. Us developpers tend to implement features or write code that we might need later.

And more often than not, it ends up being unused. Makes us loose so much time.

That's where the **YAGNI** comes in. Only write code that you need **now**. Might seem counter-intuitive but it's very useful.

Code a feature when you need it, not before. It saved me so much **time** to make a first version of this **portfolio**.

## The tech

Next comes the time to think about what technology is best suited for your **project**.

Even before starting I knew I'd use TypeScript because it makes your code self-documented and way more reliable than JavaScript (Please use TypeScript).

Also TailwindCSS just because I'm a big fan. It makes the styling part a pleasure with component frameworks like React.

```js:./tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  darkMode: "class",
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        sora: ["'Sora'", "sans-serif"],
      },
      colors: {
        // colors
      },
      animation: {
        appear: "appearance 0.2s linear",
      },
      keyframes: {
        appearance: {
          "0%": { transform: "translateY(16px)", opacity: "0" },
          "100%": { transform: "translateY(0)", opacity: "1" },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/typography")],
};

```

For a blog, what comes to mind first is using a CMS. As I wanted to build something myself, the idea was quickly discarded.

The idea of a dedicated headless CMS was appealing but not selected. In the end, I chose **Next.js** for its Static Site Generation (SSG).

Also the blog will not be hosted on a blogging platform so I need SEO to expose my articles to search engines. **Next.js** has built in SEO tools so that's a big plus.

## The blog

Static Site Generation is one of the most optimized way to create blogs because it's **blazingly fast** and the data doesn't change much. It makes your GitHub repo act like a free headless CMS.

All my **blog posts** are written in the `/data/posts` folder and the content is scraped thanks to Node's `fs` module and `gray-matter`.

```ts:./libs/posts.ts
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";
import readingTime from "reading-time";

const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), "data", "posts");

export const getAllPostsSorted = () => {/* code */ };

export const getAllPostsPaths = () => { /* code */ };

export const getPostData = async (slug: string) => {
  const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${slug}.mdx`);
  const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, "utf8");
  const matterResult = matter(fileContent);
  const readTime = readingTime(matterResult.content).text;

  return {
    meta: matterResult.data,
    mdx: matterResult.content,
    readTime,
  };
};
```

The gray-matter module allows to parse text files and separate meta data, written in a YAML format at the top, and the main content.

For the **articles**, I chose **MDX** instead of simple markdown for three main reasons. First was to be able to use the built-in **Next.js** Image component to optimize automatically article images.

Second, I was curious about **MDX** and wanted to learn by using it in a **project**. The quickest way to understand new technologies.

Last reason was that I could import custom React components and make future articles more interactive (not really **YAGNI** but still, I learned a lot so it was worth it).

## The portfolio

For the **project**, I wanted something really simple and didn't want to spend a lot of time finding a solution to store it in a database or reuse the original scraping like the `fs module` so I opted for quickest solution.

Yes. A simple array. An easy method but one that will have limitations in readability when I have many, many projects. Still, It works great now so there is no need to overcomplicate things.

```ts:./types/types.ts
// Array of Project objects

interface Project {
  repoLink: string;
  demoLink: string;
  title: string;
  tags: string[];
  description?: string;
  imgLink?: string;
}
```

The `description` and `imgLink` keys are optional so that I can reuse the component and omit them in the Home Page. Thinking about reusability is key in component framework.

## Template

As a contribution to open source, I built a template so that you can have your **blog / portfolio** like mine set up in just a few minutes.

Here are the links:

1. [Template repository](https://github.com/Nabil-Y/portfolio-template)
1. [Live Demo](https://portfolio-template-amber.vercel.app/)

To get started, follow the instructions in the repository's Readme. Please star the project if you found it helpful.

## Why this blog ?

There are many reasons to write. As a **frontend developer**, I want to have a place online to talk about my **side projects** and how they're made to help people building similar **projects**.

I was helped by many **developers** who documented their projects and wrote tutorials so I wanted to give back to the community.

Twitter is a great place to connect with people but the tweet format isn't the best for sharing knowledge.

Then the idea of writing a blog came to mind. **Blog posts** are great for sharing knowledge and quite popular in tech.

Actually, it's not hard to start. Solutions like [**Hashnode**](hashnode.com) or [**dev.to**](dev.to) make creating your blog require no more than 10 minutes of your precious time.

Then why are you not reading this post in one of these awesome websites? They have many pros like content management, comments and likes, SEO but I actually wanted to make the blog myself.

I think it's best to try and make something yourself before using a ready-made solution if you want to **learn** new concepts faster.

There's a big difference between reading about the problems a tool solves and experiencing these problems first hand.

That's why I love **learning** by making projects with tools I never used before. I read the docs first and when stuck, I look for a solution.

It can seem odd but I enjoy the challenge and when it's complete, I feel that I've made so much progress.

Also I've read about the Feynman technique to improve the **learning** experience and writing about what I study is a great way to apply this technique.

```js
// The Feynman Technique

1. "Learn something new"
2. "Write an explanation"
3. "Simplify it"
4. "Simplify it again"
```

This technique consists in explaining something in the simplest way so that ideally even a child could understand.

It's no easy feat to explain a complex concept in simple words if you don't understand said concept very well so I find that to be a great exercice.

Did I explain it simply ? Send me a message on Twitter if I didn't !

## Blog content

As I've already said, I want to share my **developer** journey and what I **learn** while I grow in this industry.

First I want to share the processes behind **side projects** and in the future I'll write about tools, programming languages, concepts I'm currently working with.

The **programming** world is so vast that you can't study everything in one life. It's difficult for someone like me who wants to understand everything but choices have to be made.

So I doubled down on the **frontend** path with **JavaScript**,**TypeScript** and **React**.

Now that I finally understand more about how **React** works, I'd like to create small **projects** with Vue or Angular to understand their differences.

Also **backend development** is a world that I find interesting and that makes me want to know more about it.

I use **Node** and still have much to learn about it but I'm open to **learn** new languages in the future like Java or Go.

Having some experience with **React** can also open the path of mobile development with React-Native. It's a fascinating idea but I'll stay focused on **frontend** for now.

When I complete a side project or discover something worth writing about, you can expect a new **blog post** soon.

For the next one, I'll write about how I made this **personal website**, the thought process and the challenges.

I'll tell you on Twitter when it's done. You can follow me [**here**](https://www.twitter.com/nabil-io) if you're interested.
